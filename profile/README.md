## Idea
Idea came to Oleksey Pitenko on the third day of war when he was disconnected from the Web for day in a half. And peer-to-peer messangers weren't working because of low popularity such kind of apps. </br>
And we think we found elegant solution, using Diia app.

## Project development
We divided the whole idea into a three layers.
### First layer
First layer is decentralized chat. That’s what we build during hackathon. So the chat is running on Near Blockchain testnet, meaning it’s completely serverless.
### Second layer
After this part we will move to the distributed network. Working on Bluetooth and creating this hybrid connection.
### Final layer
And then we think going to the hardware, building what we called anonymous nodes.</br>
It consists of a microcontroller, a GSM module, a Bluetooth transmitter, and a battery. You can build one yourself for the cost of around 15 bacs. And the price of mass production will be much lower.
### Utility 
We see different utilities of this product. It can be placed at a lamppost or traffic light. It can be connected to the cigarette lighter in the MES car. So the 15-backs can save hundreds of lives.
